# Factor and Data Frame in R 
# Factors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. 
# They can store both strings and integers. They are useful in the columns which
# have a limited number of unique values. Like "Male, "Female" and True, False etc.
# They are useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.
