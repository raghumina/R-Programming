## ASIIGNMENTS IN R 
x = 1 
print(x)    #   = SIGN CAN ALSO BE USED BUT ( <- ) THIS ASSIGNMET IS MORE PREFERABLE 

x1 <- 12    # LIKE THIS ONE 
print(x1)

name = hello     # THE CHARACTER VALUES SHOULD BE IN ""
print(name)

name1 = "Jerry"
print(name1)       # like this character values should be in ( "" ).

##  FUNCTIONS IN R 

# 1ST FUNCTION 
# print() function

## COMPUTATIONS 

1 + 1   # ADDITION 

22 - 22  # SUBSTRACTION 

31 / 0   # DIVIDE 

45 / 10

22 * 10  # MULTIPLY
